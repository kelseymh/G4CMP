                        production.
2016-08-29  G4CMP-4  : new G4CMPEnergyPartition factory to create primary
                        phonons, charge carriers from energy deposits.

2016-07-20  g4cmp-V00-05-00 Drop external K-Vg lookup tables, support all
                        symmetry groups; merging branch 'crystalParams' 

2016-06-30  g4cmp-V00-04-00 Integrate KVmapper code (eigensolver) into
                        lattice.  Can compute phonon kinematics directly
                        instead of via lookup tables.  Tag V00-04-00

                        Replacexplicit TrackInfo calls and casting with use
                        of G4CMPProcessUtils::GetTrackInfo().

2016-06-14  g4cmp-V00-03-00 Consolidate demos under examples/, add tests/
                        and tools/ directories.  Follow changes in
                        GNUmakefile and CMakeLists.txt everywhere.  Install
                        phonon K-Vg lookup table code under tools/.
