						QHull 2015.
2016-10-10  G4CMP-42 : Make particle transmission default to killing the
                        track. Also update the charge demo to force
                        reflection when absorption fails.
2016-10-10  G4CMP-26 : Make sure G4VSolid gets a local position to find the
						surface normal

						and TriLinearInterp.

2016-10-06  g4cmp-V01-00-01
2016-10-06  G4CMP-38 : Add G4WORKDIR path to user's library search path.
2016-10-04  G4CMP-32 : Fix IV scattering to always choose a different valley
						(otherwise 1/4 scatters go into same valley.

2016-10-03  g4cmp-V01-00-00 Initial "production capable" release.
2016-10-03  G4CMP-31 : Add track weight to hits.
2016-09-09  G4CMP-1  : Add recombination process
2016-09-08  G4CMP-25 : Charges now emit phonons at absorption. Fix compile
						issues
2016-09-07  G4CMP-23 : Use electrode pattern in G4CMPBoundaryUtils for
						absorption, with charge example demo.
2016-09-07  G4CMP-26 : Add boundary awareness to CreatePhonon() and
                        CreateChargeCarrier()
2016-09-07  G4CMP-12 : Improve interface between MeshElectricField and
						TriLinearInterp.
2016-09-06  G4CMP-9  : Efield caches last lookup for speed.
2016-09-04  G4CMP-22 : refactor boundary processes to put common code into a
						shared class.
2016-09-01  G4CMP-15 : provide minimum-energy cuts and track-killing process.
2016-08-31  G4CMP-20 : Define new parameter to downscale charge carrier
						production.
2016-08-29  G4CMP-4  : new G4CMPEnergyPartition factory to create primary
						phonons, charge carriers from energy deposits.

2016-07-20  g4cmp-V00-05-00 Drop external K-Vg lookup tables, support all
                        symmetry groups; merging branch 'crystalParams'

2016-06-30  g4cmp-V00-04-00 Integrate KVmapper code (eigensolver) into
						lattice.  Can compute phonon kinematics directly
						instead of via lookup tables.  Tag V00-04-00

2016-06-24  g4cmp-V00-03-02 Merge branch 'improveTrackInfoUse' --
						Replacexplicit TrackInfo calls and casting with use
						of G4CMPProcessUtils::GetTrackInfo().

2016-06-14  g4cmp-V00-03-00 Consolidate demos under examples/, add tests/
						and tools/ directories.  Follow changes in
						GNUmakefile and CMakeLists.txt everywhere.  Install
						phonon K-Vg lookup table code under tools/.

2016-06-14  g4cmp-V00-02-02 Improves lattice orientation code.

[ All work prior to this was initial development, without formal releases. ]
